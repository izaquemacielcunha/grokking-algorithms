# 📖 Grokking Algorithms – Learning Journey 🚀

This repository is my personal space to document everything I learn while reading **Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People** by *Aditya Bhargava*.

## 📌 Purpose of This Repo
- 📚 **Notes & Summaries** – Key takeaways from each chapter
- 💻 **Code Implementations** – Writing and testing the algorithms from the book
- 🔍 **Insights & Observations** – My thoughts and understanding of concepts
- ✅ **Exercises & Challenges** – Solutions to problems and additional practice

## 🛠️ Structure
Each chapter has its own folder, containing:
- A **README** summarizing the chapter
- Code implementations in Java (where applicable)
- Additional exercises and experiments

## 🚀 My Goals
✔ Develop a deep understanding of fundamental algorithms  
✔ Improve problem-solving skills  
✔ Strengthen coding abilities through hands-on practice  
✔ Build an algorithm reference for future projects

## 🔄 Work in Progress
I'll be updating this repo as I progress through the book. Feel free to follow along, suggest improvements, or discuss ideas!

This keeps it personal and focused on your learning. Let me know if you'd like any tweaks! 😊
